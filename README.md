# snakegame

This is a classic Snake Game implemented using Python's tkinter library. The game features a grid-based environment where the player controls a snake that moves in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The objective is to guide the snake to eat the red food blocks that appear randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the player's score increases. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the snake's speed increases with the score. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body. The player can restart the game by pressing any key after a "Game Over" message is displayed. This simple yet engaging game demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like event handling, collision detection, and dynamic rendering.
